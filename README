About this project:
===================

OpenWindMap is a network of wind sensors (https://www.openwindmap.org), collecting data from the devices via the Sigfox network.

This project is about building a device (hardware and software) to process the measurements from a commercial wind sensor and send data via Sigfox messages (8 bits every 10min)


The wind sensor (for wind direction and speed) is from Peet Bros (used in Ultimeter weather station)

The core of the project is an Arduino MKRFox1200, using a SAM D21 microcontroler and a sigfox transmitter.
The device is powered by a small battery (3.7V) and a solar panel.
Read the doc/bom.txt for a complete list of required parts.


In the hardware directory, you will find schematics for connecting parts together.
(schematics done with Kicad/eeschema)

In src directory, you will find the code to upload on the Arduino board.


Follow these steps:
===================

Once you have completed the hardware:

0/ If not done, install the Arduino IDE on your computer (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
 
1/ Launch Arduino IDE and, 
        -install SAMD boards in the board manager, 
        -install "Arduino Sigfox for MKR1200" lib from the lib manager

2/ Upload src/board_infos/board_infos.ino code onto the board. It will render the board identifiers (ID and PAC)
   via the serial monitor. Note these IDs to further register your board on OpenWindMap.
   
   (Note: before pushing the Upload button, trigger the bootloader by pressing quickly twice on the reset button)

3/ Upload src/firmware/firmware.ino. This code will actually manage measurements and transmit data.


4/ Once you have register your board on the OWM network, you get a station ID
   You will retrieve your data from https://www.openwindmap.org/<ID>
